## Day 1  
**Logging is like keeping a journal** 🚀

Imagine keeping a journal of your daily activities, including what you did, when you did it, and how it turned out. Logging works similarly, recording events and activities in your system, allowing you to analyze and learn from them.

##   Day 2  
**𝐌𝐞𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐬 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐥𝐢𝐤𝐞 𝐚 𝐦𝐚𝐩**

 A map provides you with a visual representation of your surroundings, helping you navigate. Metrics work similarly, providing a visual representation of your system's performance, helping you navigate complex issues.

## Day 4  
  MTTR is the boss !
Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR) is a metric that measures the average time it takes to restore a system after a failure. It's an important measure of system reliability and resilience. A lower MTTR indicates that a system can recover quickly from failures, reducing the impact on users and minimizing downtime. To improve MTTR, focus on cross-functional collaboration, automated testing and deployment, monitoring and alerting, post-mortem analysis, and training and education. By implementing these practices and tools, you can reduce the time it takes to recover from failures and improve overall system reliability.

## Day 5

⏩Imagine you are a system administrator for an e-commerce website. One day, you notice that the website is running slower than usual, and some users are reporting errors when trying to make purchases. You suspect that there may be a system issue causing these problems.

  

⏩Mean Time To Detect (MTTD) is the metric that measures how long it takes you to detect and confirm that there is indeed a system issue. For example, if it takes you 30 minutes to confirm that there is a database performance issue causing the slowdown and errors, then your MTTD for this incident is 30 minutes.

⏩A lower MTTD is generally better because it means that you can detect and respond to system issues more quickly, reducing the impact on users and minimizing downtime. In this example, if you had a monitoring and alerting system in place that automatically detected the database performance issue and alerted you immediately, your MTTD would be much lower, and you could quickly take action to resolve the issue.

 RUM involves collecting data on user interactions with a system, such as page load times, and using this data to identify and diagnose performance issues. By understanding how a system is performing for real users, organizations can make informed decisions about where to invest in system enhancements. For example, a company that provides a web-based service might use RUM to identify and address slow page load times that are impacting user experiences. By implementing RUM and using the data it provides to drive continuous improvement, organizations can improve system performance and build trust and confidence with their users.

  
## Day 8  
  
𝐒𝐩𝐚𝐧𝐬 𝐢𝐧 𝐎𝐛𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐚𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲 ✨

Spans in observability are like the individual steps you take during a journey. Just as a fitness tracker records your movements, spans capture the start and end times, as well as metadata, for each step in a transaction within your distributed system. This information is crucial for understanding performance, identifying bottlenecks, and troubleshooting issues.

For example, imagine you're ordering a pizza online. The initial client request is the first span, followed by spans for the order processing, payment processing, and order fulfillment steps. These spans are organized into a hierarchical structure, known as a trace, which allows you to visualize the entire journey of the pizza order and the relationships between the different components involved, such as the online ordering platform, the payment gateway, and the pizza delivery service. By analyzing these spans, you can identify where delays or errors occur and optimize the overall pizza ordering experience.

In observability, sampling is a strategic technique that helps you manage the vast amounts of data generated by your distributed systems. Just as a survey can provide valuable insights about a population without examining every individual, sampling allows you to collect and analyze a representative subset of your system's data, balancing the need for detailed information with practical constraints.

Effective sampling strategies empower you to focus on the most important data points, reduce storage and processing requirements, and maintain a comprehensive understanding of your system's performance. By carefully selecting which spans, logs, or metrics to sample, you can make data-driven decisions, optimize your system, and deliver a better experience for your users.

Embrace the power of sampling to unlock the full potential of observability in your organization.
